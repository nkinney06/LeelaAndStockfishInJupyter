(5/3/2021) update leela seems to be working as background redis jobs
I still need to clean up some stuff and plan to add an inline jupyter
game viewer to more easily browse the database. check back for updates.

INSTRUCTIONS
go to the docker/leela directory

edit the settings.json file accordingly

you may also need to recreate the supervisord.conf
file with the createSuper.py script: python createSuper.py > supervisord.conf

then run the following command

sudo docker build -t leela .

if this command fails and complains abount meson or whatever try running it again 
I dont know why but running it again worked for me. Ive had to run it up to three
time to get it to work. Then go to the base directory LeelaAndStockfishInJupyter/ 
and run the following command

sudo docker-compose build (if this fails literally run the same command again)


from the base directory run the following:

sudo docker-compose up -d
sudo docker exec leela jupyter notebook list

 - this command will output something like:
   Currently running servers:
   http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=66322c02303f332fa8513759d821sadgssgddddd8c242dc7 :: /src/notebooks

 - you should copy pasta the url and token into your browser
   http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=66322c02303f332fa8513754b14fddd8c242dasdhhadfhc7

 - make sure to replace 0.0.0.0 with your ip or 127.0.0.1
